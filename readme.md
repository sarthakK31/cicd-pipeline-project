# Demonstration for CI/CD deployment pipeline using Jenkins  

**Deliverables**:
This project will simulate a completely automated CI/CD deployment pipeline using Jenkins. It will essentially do the following steps (phases):
1. Pull the source code for a Java EE based Project from GIT. (SCM AUTOMATION)
 2. Compile (build) the code using Maven to generate the .war file (BUILD AUTOMATION)
 3. Run Test cases & ensure they pass. (TEST AUTOMATION)
 4. Copy the .war to a Docker build workspace (DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION)
 5. Build a Docker image for Jboss server to run the war file. (DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION)
 6. Deploy the Docker container on a target node. (DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION)
